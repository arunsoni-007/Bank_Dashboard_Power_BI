This is a Power BI Bank Dashboard created as part of my learning journey with Skill Nation, guided by Jatan Shah. The project focuses on analyzing customer demographics, financial insights, and trends for a banking dataset.

## Dashboard Highlights

- **Balance Distribution**: View customer balances grouped into categories.
- **New Customers**: Track monthly growth in new customers.
- **Age & Gender Insights**: Demographic distribution by age and gender.
- **Regional Trends**: Visualize customer data by regions in the UK.
- **Job Classification Split**: Insights into customer professions.

## Tools Used

- **Data Cleaning**: Performed using Excel and Power Query.

This project was an excellent opportunity to learn and apply concepts of data storytelling and analytics. Your feedback and suggestions are welcome!
